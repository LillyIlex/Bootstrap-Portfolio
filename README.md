# Bootstrap-Portfolio
### A portfolio showing all my live web applications, as well as my work history and contact information.

This web application will help you delve a little deeper into who I am, what I do, and why I am here. There are links to my live web app's for you to check out, as well as a breif bio section at the bottom, along with contact information. It is also an chance for me to keep all my projects in one area, a great way to be able to show off what I have learnt so far.

#### Usage
The navigation menu at the top of the application will direct you to the 3 different sections of the page. In the work section there are images of my current websites, under this you will find the skills i expect to learn throughout my time on the bootcamp. Finally you will come to an about me section and contact information above the footer.
